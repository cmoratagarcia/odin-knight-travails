# odin-knight-travails

Final project of the Advanced JS module.

Given enough turns, a knight on a standard 8x8 chess board can move from any square to any other square. Your task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
